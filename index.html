                Our students show an average increase of 150 points on the SAT, and a 3 point increase on the ACT. We believe in transparency, so we&rsquo;ve compiled data and testimonials from our former students and parents. Testive works. See for yourself!

                        "I really enjoyed this program! I took it over the summer, and it gave me plenty of free time, since I was able to study when I wanted to during the day. Because of Testive, I was able to go into the test feeling confident in my abilities to do well. I highly recommend the kind of help that Testive can provide!"

                    <p>
                        "Testive really helped my daughter excel with her ACT exam. Bringing a child's score from 30 to 33 (out of 36) is one thing, but bringing my daughter's score from a 32 to a 35, was much more difficult. And Testive did it! There was no stress for the parent. The work load was manageable for my child. She only had to spend a few hours online every week for about 3 months and she got a 35 on her ACT! I say this is a SMART way to study for a test!"

Because of Testive, I was able to go into the test feeling confident in my abilities to do well. I highly recommend the kind of help that Testive can provide!"

                        "Testive really helped my daughter excel with her ACT exam. Bringing a child's score from 30 to 33 (out of 36) is one thing, but bringing my daughter's score from a 32 to a 35, was much more difficult. And Testive did it! There was no stress for the parent. The work load was manageable for my child. She only had to spend a few hours online every week for about 3 months and she got a 35 on her ACT! I say this is a SMART way to study for a test!"

Because of Testive, I was able to go into the test feeling confident in my abilities to do well. I highly recommend the kind of help that Testive can provide!"

                        "Testive really helped my daughter excel with her ACT exam. Bringing a child's score from 30 to 33 (out of 36) is one thing, but bringing my daughter's score from a 32 to a 35, was much more difficult. And Testive did it! There was no stress for the parent. The work load was manageable for my child. She only had to spend a few hours online every week for about 3 months and she got a 35 on her ACT! I say this is a SMART way to study for a test!"

Because of Testive, I was able to go into the test feeling confident in my abilities to do well. I highly recommend the kind of help that Testive can provide!"

                        "Testive really helped my daughter excel with her ACT exam. Bringing a child's score from 30 to 33 (out of 36) is one thing, but bringing my daughter's score from a 32 to a 35, was much more difficult. And Testive did it! There was no stress for the parent. The work load was manageable for my child. She only had to spend a few hours online every week for about 3 months and she got a 35 on her ACT! I say this is a SMART way to study for a test!"

                        "I really enjoyed this program! I took it over the summer, and it gave me plenty of free time, since I was able to study when I wanted to during the day. Because of Testive, I was able to go into the test feeling confident in my abilities to do well. I highly recommend the kind of help that Testive can provide!"

                    <p>
                        "Testive really helped my daughter excel with her ACT exam. Bringing a child's score from 30 to 33 (out of 36) is one thing, but bringing my daughter's score from a 32 to a 35, was much more difficult. And Testive did it! There was no stress for the parent. The work load was manageable for my child. She only had to spend a few hours online every week for about 3 months and she got a 35 on her ACT! I say this is a SMART way to study for a test!"
